1. What does this project do?

   This project conveys Jesus' love to those 
   who do not know him and recommends good hymns and Bible words.
```

```
2. Why is this project useful?
1) The site contains the contents of one of the 
   evangelism tools, the book '4 spiritual laws'.
   It's useful because it can easily convey the gospel 
   on a computer without having to carry the book around.

2) It is easy to modify my code. So if you want to add more
   verses of Bible or hymns that you like, you can easily fix it.
   Recommend your own playlist and verses you like ! 
```

```
3. How to get started
1) Prepare your Raspberry pi

2) You need to install Apache2, MySql, PHP
  (refer to https://webnautes.tistory.com/1185)

3) Move 'final.html', 'introduce.html', 'bible.html', 'hymns.html'
   to var\www\html

[Contribution]

I wrote all the source code for this project myself, and I tried to 
debug as hard as possible. However, there might be a bug, so now it's
your turn to find a bug ( If there is no bug, then it's just happy thing ^_^)

You can modify the source code, 
Make more HTML and just add in final.html 
Add more verses which you like !
Feel free to change and add !
