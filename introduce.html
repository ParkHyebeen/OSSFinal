		<br>
		<p> Do you feel empty? Do you need love? </p>
		<p> I'd like to introduce someone who really loves you, and even died for you.</p>
		<p> His name is Jesus. </p>
		<p> He is son of God, and our Christ.</p>
		<p> Now I will tell you Four Spiritual Laws. It's about the plan for you. </p><br>

		<p> 1. God loves you and has a wonderful plan for you.</p>
		<p>(John 3:16) For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</p><br>

		<p> 2. Human is away from God in sin. Therefore, he or she cannot know God's love and plan and experience it.</p>
		<p>(Isaiah 59:1) Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear.</p><br>

		<p> 3. Jesus Christ is God's only way to solve human sins. You know God's love and plan for you through him, and you experience it.</p>
		<p>(Relevation 21:8) But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars -- they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.</p><br>

		<p> 4. We should personally welcome Jesus Christ as my Savior, my God. Then we know God's love and plan for each person and experience it.</p>
		<p>(John 14:6) Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</p><br><br>

		<p> God loves you so much and he is still waiting for you.</p>
		<p> I will pray for you. </p>
		<p> LOVE YA !!!!!!!!!! </p>
